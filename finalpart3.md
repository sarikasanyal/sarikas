# Final Project Part III: Behind the Scenes

This page includes a link to a the final version of the Shorthand story.

The second part of this page goes through insights and reflection on revisions to the story and the process of this. The dataset used for this story is also included at the end.

## Reflection & Insights

After completing Part II of the user research and mock up in Shorthand the main components of the revision were clarifying the messaging and refining the visualizations to clearly lead up to the call to action. During this process the audience for the final data story remained the same (other organizations interested in joining the LAVA Coalition and potential funders) in order to keep the core message of the story intact. 

During the user research process most of the areas that needed clarification and strengthening were the messaging and the overall data visualizations which seemed to come across differently to each user. In order to highlight the overall core of the story some parts of the story were eliminated, mainly talking about other emergency grants because this seemed to lead the audience to think LAVA Coalition would be giving out grants instead of highlighting the importance of funding the coalition (the message in the mock up was doing the opposite of what was intended). Part 2 also highlighted how local arts agencies were impacted which didn’t quite speak to the economic impact on the small organizations itself so for the final version that data was completely eliminated to keep the focus around the small organizations and build up to the need for funding these local organizations. Although a LAVA Coalition member wasn’t able to give feedback, I was able to get feedback from a Grants Manager I work with who has intimate knowledge of how funders see data and information from organizations. This helped in informing how to frame the “why” of funding or joining the coalition and the need to highlight the impact of the organizations themselves instead of just talking about what they plan to do. Because the data around these organizations is not publicly available, I was able to turn this part into a more personal story about an artist who has worked with these organizations and the positive outcomes for the artist, the communities served, and the council districts for LA County to show how this type of funding can continue to build up the local artist community. With all of this in mind, the story became a little more layered by first showing how organizations implement arts programs into the impact that COVID has had and then finally to how this affects the community the coalition is speaking to. 

Because of these decisions to revise the visualizations completely and the messaging, the design elements shifted a bit as well. The introduction of sources of revenue for organizations at the beginning helped to guide the audience into the topic, whether you are an expert in the field or not. The decision to keep the visualizations in one part of the story was to allow the audience to physically interact with the data and see it start to get more focused on this area specifically. From here, the design on giving a narrative of the coalition through their own website and their own words. When creating the design for the artist story, I wanted to show this through a map format to give it more context into which areas were served (because this is important to how the county funds each organization) and how the artist was able to stay local but move around to different spaces within the county and reach more people. I originally wanted to create a timeline but this didn’t give much context to the importance of communities and areas served. The intention behind making the ending more text heavy was to give the story a sense of urgency to lead up to the call to action as the audience had time to reflect on the data visualizations from earlier in the story.

Throughout the process, and especially after Part 2 of this, the most significant takeaway was in how different audiences react or engage with different elements of the story. Because this is a field I understand well it was important for me to gain insight from someone who didn’t know these stories as well as I did but to also get the complete opposite from an expert in the work. This allowed me to create a more balanced story with the hopes that anyone could open this and gain some awareness. It was really insightful and surprising to get this feedback because the original version came across very differently than intended which highlighted an obvious observation that different people will have significantly differing takeaways and is something I hope to continue to build on with projects like this. I also really enjoyed being able to stack the visualizations, even though it’s all from the same dataset, to hone in on the story and the value in a variety of visualization formats which can guide audiences in and out of specific parts of the topic.
