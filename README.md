Hi! I'm Sarika (she/her/hers), a second year Master of Arts Management student at CMU currently enrolled in Telling Stories with Data. My path within the MAM program is centered around public art, community development and philanthropy. Before arriving in Pittsburgh I lived in LA for 8 years where I worked in visual arts oriented organizations working on exhibition management, education and artist development. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to think through data more efficiently to create impactful visualizations which I can use as a tool within my personal interests and my career within the arts. I am also a very visual learner so I hope to gain more insight into how I can improve in creating visualizations myself and gather resources on how to really tell a story well.

This section will have specific notes on tools or language to refer back to for creating visualizations.
