# Final Project Part I: 

This page includes a high level summary of the final project and the framework surrounding this topic as well as the structure which will outline the final ask. 

## Summary

Local Arts Agencies (LAA), a primary source of funding for smaller arts organizations throughout the country, have been substantially affected by COVID. 
The smaller arts organizations funded by LAA’s work directly and responsively with local communities and have a long lasting positive impact in their long term social, educational and economic challenges. 
This project will take a look at the ways that LAA’s in Los Angeles have been affected and the ripple effect onto smaller arts organizations who have found a solution in forming coalitions for mutual support and why we should support them.

## The Data

### Dataset 1 (Primary Data Set): [Profile of Local Arts Agencies (LAA), nationally](https://www.americansforthearts.org/by-program/networks-and-councils/local-arts-network/facts-and-figures/profile-of-local-arts-agencies)

This is a dataset created by the Americans for the Arts from 2019 which is a compilation of data gathered from local arts agencies across the country. The raw data is separated into eight sections which explore the different aspects of an LAA - organizational management to partnerships and programming to financial health. This dataset will be used mainly to look at the financial health of LAA’s across the country pre-COVID.

### Dataset 2: [The Economic Impact of COVID on the Arts & Cultures Sector](https://www.americansforthearts.org/by-topic/disaster-preparedness/the-economic-impact-of-coronavirus-on-the-arts-and-culture-sector)
This is a dashboard also created by the Americans for the Arts, data gathered post-covid and is still a live dataset which organizations are continuously contributing to. The data in here will be used in two ways: first to look at the impact on COVID nationally on LAA and secondly to zoom in on LA County LAA’s to view the loss they have suffered. 

### Dataset 3: A map of LAA funded arts organizations in Los Angeles County
This dataset will contain all zip codes or exact locations of organizations funded by a local arts agency to be able to create a map and visually show the impact these LAA’s create through their funding, the ripple effect of the covid crisis.
