# Final Project Part I: 

This page includes a high level summary of the final project and the framework surrounding this topic as well as the structure which will outline the final ask. 

## Summary

Local Arts Agencies (LAA), a primary source of funding for smaller arts organizations throughout the country, have been substantially affected by COVID. 
The smaller arts organizations funded by LAA’s work directly and responsively with local communities and have a long lasting positive impact in their long term social, educational and economic challenges. 
This project will take a look at the ways that LAA’s in Los Angeles have been affected and the ripple effect onto smaller arts organizations who have found a solution in forming coalitions for mutual support and why we should support them.
