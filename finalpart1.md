# Final Project Part I

This page includes a high level summary of the final project and the framework surrounding this topic as well as the structure which will outline the final ask. 

## Summary

Local Arts Agencies (LAA), a primary source of funding for smaller arts organizations throughout the country, have been substantially affected by COVID. The smaller arts organizations funded by LAA work directly and responsively with local communities and have a long lasting positive impact in their social, educational and economic challenges. 
This project will take a look at the ways that LAA in Los Angeles have been affected and the ripple effect onto smaller arts organizations who have found a solution in forming coalitions for mutual support and why we should support them.

## The Data

### Dataset 1 (Primary Data Set): [Profile of Local Arts Agencies (LAA), nationally](https://www.americansforthearts.org/by-program/networks-and-councils/local-arts-network/facts-and-figures/profile-of-local-arts-agencies)

This is a dataset created by the Americans for the Arts from 2019 which is a compilation of data gathered from local arts agencies across the country. The raw data is separated into eight sections which explore the different aspects of an LAA - organizational management to partnerships and programming to financial health. This dataset will be used mainly to look at the financial health of LAA’s across the country pre-COVID.

### Dataset 2: [The Economic Impact of COVID on the Arts & Cultures Sector](https://www.americansforthearts.org/by-topic/disaster-preparedness/the-economic-impact-of-coronavirus-on-the-arts-and-culture-sector)
This is a dashboard also created by the Americans for the Arts, data gathered post-covid and is still a live dataset which organizations are continuously contributing to. The data in here will be used in two ways: first to look at the impact on COVID nationally on LAA and secondly to zoom in on LA County LAA’s to view the loss they have suffered. 

### Dataset 3: A map of LAA funded arts organizations in Los Angeles County
This dataset will contain all zip codes or exact locations of organizations funded by a local arts agency to be able to create a map and visually show the impact these LAA’s create through their funding, the ripple effect of the covid crisis. 

## The Method & Medium

The method that will be used to complete the project is Shorthand to create a seamless and straightforward story using their “scrollytelling” method. This platform will allow for some interaction with the viewer in the way they can scroll from one section to another and clearly see certain contrasts which is important to this story (mainly the financial impacts, the erasure of an entire arts sector). 

In creating this story on shorthand, I will go through a process of tightening up my story arc based on feedback, brainstorming or sketching out different types of charts that create the most impact keeping consistency in mind. This will lead into prototypes with different charts in Flourish and then create the final versions in Tableau. The idea is to create multiple different versions of telling the story and getting feedback from a few people to determine which method would work best for this story and lead viewers to action.
