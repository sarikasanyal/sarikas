# Data Critique & Redesign: [Los Angeles Artist Census](https://losangelesartistcensus.com/imgs/LA%20Artist%20Census%20Quick%20REPORT.jpg) 

## Part 1: Original Data Visualization

This data visualization is part of an initiative which began last year in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles Artist Census was started to gather data from artists specifically residing in LA County as a way to shed some light on aspects or conditions of artists living in LA through a quantitative perspective. The information provided in this “quick report” is aimed at highlighting points that may be used to further advocate for artists in Los Angeles. 

I was curious to see this report come out when it did because I had been following the LA Artist Census group closely for the past year. I had seen, through my own network, all of the ways the group was partnering with local arts organizations to bring more visibility to the surveys that were sent out. While the data in this report is a preliminary overview of the information that has been gathered, it serves as a resource and provides a tool for those interested in learning more about the creative economy.

## Part 2

While going through the critique method the biggest thing I realized with this chart was it was hard for me to understand anything that was happening at first glance. I knew from the title of the chart that this was about income, but the number labeling and placement plus the outlines of the bar and the additional text explanation around the chart made this less intuitive. Through this method I concluded that while the information is very useful and valid, it is completely lacking in perceptibility.

To help create structure around the process I referred to the Good Charts Workbook warm up exercises from this past week. The steps included writing out what exactly the original chart was conveying to me vs. what the actual purpose was and then into writing out a couple of statements about what I think the statement should look like:

This chart is trying to show that income ranges as an artist in LA is below the median household which creates unstable financial situations. I want a visualization to represent the need for more financial resources for artists and increase in support by comparing median households to those who fall below that. There is a gap between what the majority of artists make and the county median income.

From here, I noted keywords such as “income ranges”, “comparing”, “median income”, “gap between” which directly led to my next step of brainstorming chart types. The short list I came up with was a stacked bar, a treemap or a unit map. After attempting to sketch some of these out, I landed on the stacked bar chart. I used feedback from a couple of people who have very different backgrounds and experiences with data viz so that I could understand some of my own biases or assumptions which may be embedded into my redesign. The main critique was to rework the color gradient, shifting the orientation of the stacked bar and clarifying/simplifying the labeling. There was additional feedback surrounding adding more context to where these numbers came from, unfortunately, the original data source is private so I didn’t have access to this.
