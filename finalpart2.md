# Final Project Part II

This page includes a link to a draft of the Shorthand version for the final project - the design elements and wording isn't final but it lays out the framework for the story and placement of data visualizations. 

The second part of this page goes through the process of the user research and feedback recieved ending with revisions for the final portion.

### Feedback Summary

Overall, the common theme across all user feedback was clarity in messaging and some of the visualizations. 
While the direct messaging portions came across well, there are opportunities to refine these by reframing some of the messaging and wording to focus in more on the L.A. arts sector and by offering more context around fundraising in visual arts organizations. 
With the visualizations, there is opportunity to improve and clarify the designs and some areas where data can be replaced for a better set of information to not lose focus on the main point.
