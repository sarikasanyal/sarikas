## Part 2 - Government Debt: Grid of Lines Chart
This version uses the sparklines layout as a reference to visualize all different countries in one image.

## Part 4 - Different Methods of Visualization

In this exercise, each visualization built upon one another to create more in depth narratives around government debt across the world. The first bar chart really just indicates where countries are on a basic level of general debt-to-GDP ratio at a given time (year). As we get a bit more detailed in the grid of lines chart we are able to see how each country's debt-to-GDP ratio has changed over time and we see a common trend where the ratio actually seems to be flattening out at 2019 or starting to decrease. The sparklines layout gives a decent overview of all of the countries overall if we want to just have a high level view of what's happening with the ratio in specific areas. It doesn't, however, highlight certain aspects that may hold important or key information in telling this story. Because of this general overview it actually looks like there is a more positive outcome with the ratio flattening and decreasing in most countries, which is why the title in this one reads "Positive Outlook on Government Sustainability Across the World (in most countries)". 

The final data visualization (scatter plot with time slider) goes far more in depth into not only what this ratio looks like per country but what it looks like holistically. In this animated visualization we see a different trend than the line chart. This new version tells us that the ratio is actually increasing at high rates, we see most of the bubbles going up. The animation in the bubbles is done so that the label for a country shows up on the bubble once it crosses a certain value, indicating that it is continuing to increase into values that could be problematic for financial sustainability. Using this method also highlights outliers almost immediately without having to add too much color which could be distracting - we just want to focus on trends here. We see how Japan continues on an upwards trend over time. This particular visualization gives a better comprehensive interpretation of debt ratios in relation to time.
